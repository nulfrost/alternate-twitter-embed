    <h1>Alternate Twitter Embeds</h1>
    <p>
      Due to Elon's dumbass decision to require people to have an account to
      view tweets it also broke embeds literally everywhere else. Not everyone
      has an account (and shouldn't have to) and most people would just like to
      view a tweet without having to fucking click it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, enjoy this for as long as it works. I'll continue updating this
      as long as there's a way to get around embeds not working.

    <h2>How to use:</h2>
    <p>
      Just continue using twitter as you would, whenever you use the "copy link
      to tweet" button it will just add a mirror to the url so it properly
      embeds wherever you paste it.
